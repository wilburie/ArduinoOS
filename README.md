# ArduinoOS
ArduinoOS is a program for your arduino to make it into a poor man's Terminal.
# Setup
First set up the pins, then install the code.

To acsess the computer, go into the Arduino IDE. Click on Tools > Serial Monitor. 
It is reccomended that you max out the size of the monitor so you can have the biggest display!

If you don't want to use the IDE then you can use PuTTY but it's way slower and not reccomended.
# Pins
BLUE LED - pin 5
WHITE LED - pin 6
RED LED - pin 7
GREEN LED - pin 8
DHT-11 - pin 2
# Notes
The default password for ArduinoOS is "1066". You can change this if you want by going into the code and scrolling until you reach the string "password".
